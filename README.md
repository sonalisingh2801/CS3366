Elevator are make humans day to day life more convenient. Most common things used in elevator are,
1.) Floor Button
2.)Opening and Closing Button in elevator
3.)Help button in case of emergency
Elevator are made user interactive which includes the common sequence of actions like up, down, closing, opening and many more.
But sometimes the elevator designer can make some of the common mistake. As shown in the image we can point out some of the mistake as listed below,
1.)Fire and Emergency elevator operations are missing, in case of emergency no certain guidelines to follow.
2.)Un-neccessary use of the Up-Down button, the user would be confused to press the downard arrow button instead of the floor number
3.)Negative signs can confuse the user about the floor.
4.)'P' or '-1'  can confuse the user as P indicates the parking and -1 also might indicate the same.
5.) Elevator can carry certain weights or it can create malfunction, which haven't shown in the image.

We can solve the above issues by implementating the solutions like,

1.)Instead of using the negative sign, we can try to indicate the basement parking that is B1 or B2 for lower basement.

2.) In case of emergency, include the emergency contact like,
i) Customer care for Elevators
ii) Security contact of the Building
3.)Place the phone on the certain level which can be used by the disable person as well.
4.) For visually disabled person, the braille language or sound indication should be used.
